##### About Pomodoro technique
  The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals,   traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped       kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. For this project, you will implement a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique.
